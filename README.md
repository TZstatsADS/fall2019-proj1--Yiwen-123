### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Mt data story
+ This project is conducted by [Yiwen Ma]

+ Project summary: This project aims at comparing the lyrics among different genres from several aspects. Firstly, the number of words in each song is counted and ranked. Then, wordcloud is applied to view the most frequent word used in the whole data set and each genre indipendently. Thirdly, TFIDF is applied to find the important words in each genre. Finally, sentiment analysis is processed to detect the emotion of each genre using nrc emotion lexicon .
